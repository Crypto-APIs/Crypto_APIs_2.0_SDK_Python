```python
from cryptoapis.models.tokens_forwarding_success import TokensForwardingSuccess

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of TokensForwardingSuccess from a JSON string
tokens_forwarding_success_instance = TokensForwardingSuccess.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print TokensForwardingSuccess.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
tokens_forwarding_success_dict = tokens_forwarding_success_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TokensForwardingSuccess from a dict
tokens_forwarding_success_form_dict = tokens_forwarding_success.from_dict(tokens_forwarding_success_dict)
