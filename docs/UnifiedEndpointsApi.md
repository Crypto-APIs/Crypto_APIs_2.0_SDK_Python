# **get_address_details**
> GetAddressDetailsR get_address_details(blockchain, network, address)

Get Address Details

Through this endpoint the customer can receive basic information about a given address based on confirmed/synced blocks only. In the case where there are any incoming or outgoing **unconfirmed** transactions for the specific address, they **will not** be counted or calculated here.

# **get_transaction_details_by_transaction_id**
> GetTransactionDetailsByTransactionIDR get_transaction_details_by_transaction_id(blockchain, network, transaction_id)

Get Transaction Details By Transaction ID

Through this endpoint customers can obtain details about a transaction by the transaction's unique identifier. In UTXO-based protocols like BTC there are attributes such as `transactionId` and transaction `hash`. They still could be different. In protocols like Ethereum there is only one unique value and it's `hash`.
