# **list_transactions_by_block_height**
> ListTransactionsByBlockHeightR list_transactions_by_block_height(blockchain, network, height, context=context, limit=limit, offset=offset)

List Transactions by Block Height

This endpoint will list transactions by an attribute `blockHeight`. The transactions listed will detail additional information such as hash, addresses, time of creation in Unix timestamp, etc.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (ApiKey):
```python
import time
import os
import cryptoapis
from cryptoapis.models.list_transactions_by_block_height_r import ListTransactionsByBlockHeightR
from cryptoapis.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.cryptoapis.io
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = cryptoapis.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
configuration.api_key['ApiKey'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['ApiKey'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with cryptoapis.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = cryptoapis.UnifiedEndpointsApi(api_client)
    blockchain = 'bitcoin' # str | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
    network = 'testnet' # str | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"goerli\" are test networks.
    height = 673852 # int | Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \"Genesis block\".
    context = 'yourExampleString' # str | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional)
    limit = 50 # int | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. (optional) (default to 50)
    offset = 0 # int | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. (optional) (default to 0)

    try:
        # List Transactions by Block Height
        api_response = api_instance.list_transactions_by_block_height(blockchain, network, height, context=context, limit=limit, offset=offset)
        print("The response of UnifiedEndpointsApi->list_transactions_by_block_height:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling UnifiedEndpointsApi->list_transactions_by_block_height: %s\n" % e)
```
