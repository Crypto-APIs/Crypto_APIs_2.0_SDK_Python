```python
from cryptoapis.models.block_mined import BlockMined

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of BlockMined from a JSON string
block_mined_instance = BlockMined.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print BlockMined.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
block_mined_dict = block_mined_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of BlockMined from a dict
block_mined_form_dict = block_mined.from_dict(block_mined_dict)
