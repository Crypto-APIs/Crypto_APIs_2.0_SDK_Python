# **delete_blockchain_event_subscription**
> DeleteBlockchainEventSubscriptionR delete_blockchain_event_subscription(blockchain, network, reference_id, context=context)

Delete Blockchain Event Subscription

Through this endpoint the customer can delete blockchain event subscriptions they have by attributes `referenceId` and `network`.    Currently Crypto APIs 2.0 offers certain Blockchain event endpoints which allow the user to subscribe for one/a few/all and receive callback notifications when the specific event occurs.    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn't happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}
