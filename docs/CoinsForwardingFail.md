# create an instance of CoinsForwardingFail from a JSON string
coins_forwarding_fail_instance = CoinsForwardingFail.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print CoinsForwardingFail.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
coins_forwarding_fail_dict = coins_forwarding_fail_instance.to_dict()
