## Example

```python
from cryptoapis.models.get_last_mined_block_ribsbc import GetLastMinedBlockRIBSBC

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of GetLastMinedBlockRIBSBC from a JSON string
get_last_mined_block_ribsbc_instance = GetLastMinedBlockRIBSBC.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print GetLastMinedBlockRIBSBC.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
get_last_mined_block_ribsbc_dict = get_last_mined_block_ribsbc_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of GetLastMinedBlockRIBSBC from a dict
get_last_mined_block_ribsbc_form_dict = get_last_mined_block_ribsbc.from_dict(get_last_mined_block_ribsbc_dict)
