# **list_supported_assets**

List Supported Assets

This endpoint will return a list of supported assets. The asset could be a cryptocurrency or FIAT assets that we support. Each asset has a unique identifier - `assetId` and a unique symbol in the form of a string, e.g. \"BTC\".

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (ApiKey):
```python
import time
import cryptoapis
from cryptoapis.api import metadata_api
from cryptoapis.model.insufficient_credits import InsufficientCredits
from cryptoapis.model.list_supported_assets_r import ListSupportedAssetsR
from cryptoapis.model.invalid_api_key import InvalidApiKey
from cryptoapis.model.invalid_data import InvalidData
from cryptoapis.model.invalid_request_body_structure import InvalidRequestBodyStructure
from cryptoapis.model.request_limit_reached import RequestLimitReached
from cryptoapis.model.invalid_pagination import InvalidPagination
from cryptoapis.model.feature_mainnets_not_allowed_for_plan import FeatureMainnetsNotAllowedForPlan
from cryptoapis.model.unexpected_server_error import UnexpectedServerError
from cryptoapis.model.unsupported_media_type import UnsupportedMediaType
from pprint import pprint
# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = cryptoapis.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io/v2"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
configuration.api_key['ApiKey'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['ApiKey'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with cryptoapis.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = metadata_api.MetadataApi(api_client)
    context = "context_example" # str | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional)
    asset_type = "crypto" # str | Defines the type of the supported asset. This could be either \"crypto\" or \"fiat\". (optional)
    limit = 50 # int | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. (optional) if omitted the server will use the default value of 50
    offset = 10 # int | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. (optional) if omitted the server will use the default value of 0

    # example passing only required values which don't have defaults set
    # and optional values
    try:
        # List Supported Assets
        api_response = api_instance.list_supported_assets(context=context, asset_type=asset_type, limit=limit, offset=offset)
        pprint(api_response)
    except cryptoapis.ApiException as e:
        print("Exception when calling MetadataApi->list_supported_assets: %s\n" % e)
```
