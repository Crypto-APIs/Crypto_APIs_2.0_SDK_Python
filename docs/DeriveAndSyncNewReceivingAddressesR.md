## Example

```python
from cryptoapis.models.derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses_r import DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddressesR

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddressesR from a JSON string
derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses_r_instance = DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddressesR.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddressesR.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses_r_dict = derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses_r_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddressesR from a dict
derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses_r_form_dict = derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses_r.from_dict(derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses_r_dict)
