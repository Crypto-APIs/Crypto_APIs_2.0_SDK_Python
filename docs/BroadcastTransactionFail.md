json = "{}"
# create an instance of BroadcastTransactionFail from a JSON string
broadcast_transaction_fail_instance = BroadcastTransactionFail.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print BroadcastTransactionFail.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
broadcast_transaction_fail_dict = broadcast_transaction_fail_instance.to_dict()
