```python
from cryptoapis.models.block_height_reached import BlockHeightReached

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of BlockHeightReached from a JSON string
block_height_reached_instance = BlockHeightReached.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print BlockHeightReached.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
block_height_reached_dict = block_height_reached_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of BlockHeightReached from a dict
block_height_reached_form_dict = block_height_reached.from_dict(block_height_reached_dict)
