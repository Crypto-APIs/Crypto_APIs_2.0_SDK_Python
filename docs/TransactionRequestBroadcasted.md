json = "{}"
# create an instance of TransactionRequestBroadcasted from a JSON string
transaction_request_broadcasted_instance = TransactionRequestBroadcasted.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print TransactionRequestBroadcasted.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
transaction_request_broadcasted_dict = transaction_request_broadcasted_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of TransactionRequestBroadcasted from a dict
transaction_request_broadcasted_form_dict = transaction_request_broadcasted.from_dict(transaction_request_broadcasted_dict)
