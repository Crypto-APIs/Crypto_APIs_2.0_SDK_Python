# create an instance of BroadcastTransactionSuccess from a JSON string
broadcast_transaction_success_instance = BroadcastTransactionSuccess.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print BroadcastTransactionSuccess.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
broadcast_transaction_success_dict = broadcast_transaction_success_instance.to_dict()
