# **get_unconfirmed_omni_transaction_by_transaction_id__txid**
> GetUnconfirmedOmniTransactionByTransactionIDTxidResponse get_unconfirmed_omni_transaction_by_transaction_id__txid(network, transaction_id)

Get Unconfirmed Omni Transaction By Transaction ID (Txid)

Through this endpoint customers can obtain information on unconfirmed Omni transactions by an attribute `transactionId`. The transaction can have information such as hash, height, time of creation in Unix timestamp, etc.    Unconfirmed transactions are usually put in the Mempool and await verification so that they can be added to a block.
