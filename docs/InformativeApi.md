Get Transaction Request Details

Through this endpoint customers can obtain details on transaction request.    {note}This regards **transaction requests**, which is not to be confused with **transactions**. Transaction requests may not be approved due to any reason, hence a transaction may not occur.{/note}

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (ApiKey):
```python
import time
import os
import cryptoapis
from cryptoapis.models.get_transaction_request_details_r import GetTransactionRequestDetailsR
from cryptoapis.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.cryptoapis.io
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = cryptoapis.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
configuration.api_key['ApiKey'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['ApiKey'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with cryptoapis.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = cryptoapis.InformativeApi(api_client)
    transaction_request_id = '6115126693397c0006f78eb4' # str | Represents the unique ID of the transaction request.
    context = 'yourExampleString' # str | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional)

    try:

# **list_supported_tokens**
> ListSupportedTokensR list_supported_tokens(blockchain, network, context=context, limit=limit, offset=offset)

List Supported Tokens

Through this endpoint customers can obtain information on multiple tokens at once.

### Example

* Api Key Authentication (ApiKey):
```python
import time
import os
import cryptoapis
from cryptoapis.models.list_supported_tokens_r import ListSupportedTokensR
from cryptoapis.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://rest.cryptoapis.io
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = cryptoapis.Configuration(
    host = "https://rest.cryptoapis.io"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
configuration.api_key['ApiKey'] = os.environ["API_KEY"]

# Uncomment below to setup prefix (e.g. Bearer) for API key, if needed
# configuration.api_key_prefix['ApiKey'] = 'Bearer'

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with cryptoapis.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = cryptoapis.InformativeApi(api_client)
    blockchain = 'ethereum' # str | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
    network = 'goerli' # str | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"goerli\" are test networks.
    context = 'yourExampleString' # str | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user. (optional)
    limit = 50 # int | Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis. (optional) (default to 50)
    offset = 0 # int | The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items. (optional) (default to 0)

    try:
        # List Supported Tokens
        api_response = api_instance.list_supported_tokens(blockchain, network, context=context, limit=limit, offset=offset)
        print("The response of InformativeApi->list_supported_tokens:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling InformativeApi->list_supported_tokens: %s\n" % e)
```
