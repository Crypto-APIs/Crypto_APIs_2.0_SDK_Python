```python
from cryptoapis.models.derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses400_response import DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddresses400Response

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddresses400Response from a JSON string
derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses400_response_instance = DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddresses400Response.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddresses400Response.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses400_response_dict = derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses400_response_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of DeriveAndSyncNewReceivingAddresses400Response from a dict
derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses400_response_form_dict = derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses400_response.from_dict(derive_and_sync_new_receiving_addresses400_response_dict)
