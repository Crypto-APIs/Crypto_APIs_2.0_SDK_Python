            block_height (int): Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \"Genesis block\".
            operation_type (str): Defines the specific type of the operation.
            parent_hash (str): Defines the specific hash of the parent transaction.
            recipient (str): Represents the recipient address with the respective amount.
            sender (str): Represents the sender address with the respective amount.
            timestamp (int): Defines the exact date/time in Unix Timestamp when this transaction was mined, confirmed or first seen in Mempool, if it is unconfirmed.
