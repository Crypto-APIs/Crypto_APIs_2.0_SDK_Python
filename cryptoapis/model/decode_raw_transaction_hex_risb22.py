        Args:
            gas_limit (str): Represents the amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
            nonce (int): Represents the sequential running number for an address, starting from 0 for the first transaction. E.g., if the nonce of a transaction is 10, it would be the 11th transaction sent from the sender's address.
            recipient (str): The address which receives this transaction. In UTXO-based protocols like Bitcoin there could be several senders while in account-based protocols like Ethereum there is always only one recipient.
            sender (str): Represents the address which sends this transaction. In UTXO-based protocols like Bitcoin there could be several senders while in account-based protocols like Ethereum there is always only one sender.
            type (int): Specifies the transaction type as one from three options: if response returns a `\"0\"` it means the raw transaction includes legacy transaction data, if it is `\"1\"` - includes access lists for EIP2930, and if it is `\"2\"` - EIP1559 data.
